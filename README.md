# Medical Record Matching
Description: Matches medical records with missing information using various algorithms: levenshtein, double metaphone, keyboard distance, and many more custom matching algorithms. We also created many custom algorithms for confidence testing to determine how likely matches were. SQL tables were used to store algorithm information in addition to regular medical records. Also works with a CSV file.

### TODO
- add documentation
- add testing
- make more modular
- make more extensible
- make more general
- add test that the hackathon used

### Future Features/Fixes
- ask user if file was initially typed or transferred from
handwritten documents. Customize the algorithms used based
on this. In general, ask questions and customize algorithms
based on responses.
